1] Pick a programming language which is a) popular b) you are interested in learning 
2] Learn basic syntax and the structure of the language, how the programs in it are executed
   You can use online videos, tutorials and beginners books
3] Start writing simple code in that language to understand all the constructs of the language- 
   its keywords, looping, conditional statements, File I/O, 
4] Have a good setup of editor, compiler for the language, to write the code, execute it. Get comfortable with it. 
5] Solve coding puzzles using that language
 there are plenty of sites online these days for that!
6] Start writing code for small projects to do something useful
7] Read lot of code from that
