Every night between 7 pm and midnight, two computing jobs from two different sources are 
randomly started with each one lasting an hour.

Unfortunately, when the jobs simultaneously run, they cause a failure in some of the companyâ€™s
 other nightly jobs, resulting in downtime for the company that costs $1000. 

The CEO, who has enough time today to hear one word, needs a single number representing the
 annual (365 days) cost of this problem.

Note: Write a function to simulate this problem and output an estimated cost 

Bonus - How would you solve this using probability?

#Solution
'''
We can model out this scenario by implementing two random number generators across a 
spectrum from 0 to 300 minutes, modeling the time in minutes between 7 pm and midnight.

We can simulate this scenario some N number of times to get an approximation of the 
probability that overlap will occur between the two processes. Looping through the 
simulation N number of times, we can generate two random numbers and check to see if 
they overlap and append the values 1 or 0 to our array.

Then at the end, we just take the mean to get the simulated probabilities.
